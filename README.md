This BMI calculator takes an adult's weight in pounds and their height in inches, then calculates their BMI (Body Mass Index). I enjoyed creating this calculator with input fields to collect the user's name, weight, and height, using if, elif, and else statements to categorize the BMI as underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, or severely obese. I also designed the calculator using Python widgets
